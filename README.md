# US-Interwar-Shipbuilding
This repository contains a compiled and validated dataset on all major surface combatants acquired by the U.S. Navy from 1930-1940. 

The first major file is the US Interwar Shipbuilding Data CSV file. 
This data source contains data on all major surface combatants built for the U.S. Navy from 1930-1940. 
Data includes: Type, #, Name, Shipbuilder, Hull #, Light Displacement Tons, FY, Contract Award Year, Keel Laid	Date, Keel Laid Date, Launched Date, Delivery Date, and Final Disposition. 
The original data source for the file is: http://shipbuildinghistory.com/navalships.htm. The author combined and cleaned data from multiple pages into one centralized database of all major surface combatants, having removed small craft. Data was verified using primary source documents from the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Presidential Library Digital Collection. A PDF file is included in this repository as an example. Find more at http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/archives/collections/franklin/?p=collections/findingaid&id=502 (among other FDR Library Digital Collections that are relevant). 

The second major file is the US Interwar Shipyards CSV file.
This data source contains information on the 17 shipyards which produced major surface combatants for the U.S. Navy between 1930 and 1940. Data includes: Shipyard Name	, Biggest USN Ship Size Built Pre-WW2, Location, and Ownership Status (private or government-owned). 
The list of shipyards was compiled by examining shipyard locations listed in various files in http://shipbuildinghistory.com/navalships.htm as well as contemporary primary source documents from the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Presidential Library. Largest possible ship size was determined by examining FDRPL documents from the USN assessing shipyard capabilities. Locations were mapped to approximate addresses via Google Earth and are reliable enough for GIS mapping, if desired.
